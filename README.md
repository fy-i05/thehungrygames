# Title: thehungrygames

Description: This app is called The Hungry Games, which is an embedded video game in which the player can control an avatar at the bottom of the screen to play. The objective is to eat food and swallow in a timely manner or else death! The player must also avoid the rotten food, which is tinted a slight green color. The player must click the swallow button when the throat of the avatar gets full on screen, or else they will choke and die. The player can also press and hold a button while moving the character to teleport. This was a project for an embedded systems class where we used the ARM Cortext M microcontroller, so we had to use C as the coding language.

The biggest challenge was fitting the game into memory, as each of the sprites' pixels on the screen took up static memory, as did the sound files and the home/death screens. My partner and I's goal was to add more features, such as a pause button, but time (1.5 weeks) and memory limitations did not allow for additional features.

To run this project you will need an ARM Cortex M microcontroller and a PCB equipped with an audiojack, a slidepot for movement, 4 buttons for game functionality, and an LCD Screen for the display. However, if you have the above, you can download the code file and run Lab9Main.c while connected to your microcontroller. This will boot the game and you can play to your heart's content!
